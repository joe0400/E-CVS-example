Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.<br><br>  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.<br><br>  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.<br><br>  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.<br><br>  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.<br><br>  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.<br><br>  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.<br><br>  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.<br>    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.<br><br>  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take<br>    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.<br><br>  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the<br>    wall.<br><br>  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,<br>    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men<br>    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.<br><br>  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.<br><br>  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have<br>    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off<br>    their heads.<br><br>  Greg. The heads of the maids?<br><br>  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.<br>    Take it in what sense thou wilt.<br><br>  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.<br><br>  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I<br>    am a pretty piece of flesh.<br><br>  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst<br>    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of<br>    Montagues.<br><br>           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].<br><br><br>  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.<br><br>  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?<br><br>  Samp. Fear me not.<br><br>  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!<br><br>  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.<br><br>  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.<br><br>  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is<br>    disgrace to them, if they bear it.<br><br>  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br><br>  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.<br><br>  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br><br>  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?<br><br>  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.<br><br>  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my<br>    thumb, sir.<br><br>  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?<br><br>  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.<br><br>  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as<br>    you.<br><br>  Abr. No better.<br><br>  Samp. Well, sir.<br><br>                        Enter Benvolio.<br><br><br>  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my<br>    master's kinsmen.<br><br>  Samp. Yes, better, sir.<br><br>  Abr. You lie.<br><br>  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.<br>                                                     They fight.<br><br>  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]<br>    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.<br><br>                          Enter Tybalt.<br><br><br>  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br>    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.<br><br>  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,<br>    Or manage it to part these men with me.<br><br>  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word<br>    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.<br>    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.<br><br>     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or<br>                          partisans.<br><br><br>  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans!

Give me my long sword, ho!<br><br>  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?<br><br>  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come<br>    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.<br><br>                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.<br><br><br>  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.<br><br>  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.<br><br>                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.<br><br><br>  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-<br>    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br>    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!<br>    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground<br>    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word<br>    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets<br>    And made Verona's ancient citizens<br>    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments<br>    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br>    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.<br>    If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>    For this time all the rest depart away.<br>    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;<br>    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<br>    To know our farther pleasure in this case,<br>    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.<br>    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.<br>              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].<br><br>  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br>    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?<br><br>  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary<br>    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.<br>    I drew to part them. In the instant came<br>    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;<br>    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,<br>    He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br>    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.<br>    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br>    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,<br>    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.<br><br>  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?<br>    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.<br><br>  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun<br>    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,<br>    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;<br>    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore<br>    That westward rooteth from the city's side,<br>    So early walking did I see your son.<br>    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me<br>    And stole into the covert of the wood.<br>    I- measuring his affections by my own,<br>    Which then most sought where most might not be found,<br>    Being one too many by my weary self-<br>    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,<br>    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.<br><br>  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br>    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,<br>    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br>    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br>    Should in the furthest East bean to draw<br>    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,<br>    Away from light steals home my heavy son<br>    And private in his chamber pens himself,<br>    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight<br>    And makes himself an artificial night.<br>    Black and portentous must this humour prove<br>    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.<br><br>  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?<br><br>  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him<br><br>  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?<br><br>  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;<br>    But he, his own affections' counsellor,<br>    Is to himself- I will not say how true-<br>    But to himself so secret and so close,<br>    So far from sounding and discovery,<br>    As is the bud bit with an envious worm<br>    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air<br>    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br>    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,<br>    We would as willingly give cure as know.<br><br>                       Enter Romeo.<br><br><br>  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,<br>    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.<br><br>  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay<br>    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,<br>                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].<br><br>  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.<br><br>  Rom. Is the day so young?<br><br>  Ben. But new struck nine.<br><br>  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.<br>    Was that my father that went hence so fast?<br><br>  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?<br><br>  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.<br><br>  Ben. In love?<br><br>  Rom. Out-<br><br>  Ben. Of love?<br><br>  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.<br><br>  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,<br>    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!<br><br>  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,<br>    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!<br>    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<br>    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br>    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.<br>    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<br>    O anything, of nothing first create!<br>    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<br>    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<br>    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!<br>    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is<br>    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br>    Dost thou not laugh?<br><br>  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.<br><br>  Rom. Good heart, at what?<br><br>  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.<br><br>  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.<br>    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br>    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<br>    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown<br>    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br>    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;<br>    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;<br>    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.<br>    What is it else? A madness most discreet,<br>    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.<br>    Farewell, my coz.<br><br>  Ben. Soft! I will go along.<br>    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.<br><br>  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:<br>    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.<br><br>  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?<br><br>  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?<br><br>  Ben. Groan? Why, no;<br>    But sadly tell me who.<br><br>  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.<br>    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!<br>    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.<br><br>  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.<br><br>  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.<br><br>  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.<br><br>  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit<br>    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,<br>    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,<br>    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.<br>    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,<br>    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,<br>    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.<br>    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor<br>    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.<br><br>  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?<br><br>  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;<br>    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,<br>    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br>    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br>    To merit bliss by making me despair.<br>    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br>    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.<br><br>  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.<br><br>  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!<br><br>  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.<br>    Examine other beauties.<br><br>  Rom. 'Tis the way<br>    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.<br>    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,<br>    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.<br>    He that is strucken blind cannot forget<br>    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.<br>    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<br>    What doth her beauty serve but as a note<br>    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?<br>    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.<br><br>  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

'Twas no need, I trow,<br>    To bid me trudge.<br>    And since that time it is eleven years,<br>    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,<br>    She could have run and waddled all about;<br>    For even the day before, she broke her brow;<br>    And then my husband (God be with his soul!<br>    'A was a merry man) took up the child.<br>    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?<br>    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;<br>    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,<br>    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'<br>    To see now how a jest shall come about!<br>    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,<br>    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,<br>    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'<br><br>  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.<br><br>  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh<br>    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'<br>    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow<br>    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;<br>    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.<br>    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?<br>    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;<br>    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'<br><br>  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.<br><br>  Nurse. Peace, I have done.

It is an honour that I dream not of.<br><br>  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,<br>    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.<br><br>  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,<br>    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,<br>    Are made already mothers. By my count,<br>    I was your mother much upon these years<br>    That you are now a maid.

Verona's summer hath not such a flower.<br><br>  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.<br><br>  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?<br>    This night you shall behold him at our feast.<br>    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,<br>    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;<br>    Examine every married lineament,<br>    And see how one another lends content;<br>    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies<br>    Find written in the margent of his eyes,<br>    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br>    To beautify him only lacks a cover.<br>    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride<br>    For fair without the fair within to hide.<br>    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,<br>    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;<br>    So shall you share all that he doth possess,<br>    By having him making yourself no less.<br><br>  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men<br><br>  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?<br><br>  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;<br>    But no more deep will I endart mine eye<br>    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.<br><br>                        Enter Servingman.<br><br><br>  Serv.

You have dancing shoes<br>    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead<br>    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.<br><br>  Mer. You are a lover.

And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-<br>    Too great oppression for a tender thing.<br><br>  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,<br>    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.<br><br>  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.<br>    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.<br>    Give me a case to put my visage in.<br>    A visor for a visor!

I mean, sir, in delay<br>    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.<br>    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits<br>    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.<br><br>  Rom.

O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br>    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes<br>    In shape no bigger than an agate stone<br>    On the forefinger of an alderman,<br>    Drawn with a team of little atomies<br>    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;<br>    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,<br>    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;<br>    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;<br>    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;<br>    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;<br>    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,<br>    Not half so big as a round little worm<br>    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;<br>    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br>    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br>    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.<br>    And in this state she 'gallops night by night<br>    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;<br>    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;<br>    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br>    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br>    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br>    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,<br>    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br>    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail<br>    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,<br>    Then dreams he of another benefice.<br>    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,<br>    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br>    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon<br>    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br>    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two<br>    And sleeps again.

What of that?<br>    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br>    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.<br>    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br>    Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br>    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br>    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br>    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars<br>    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br>    Would through the airy region stream so bright<br>    That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br>    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!<br>    O that I were a glove upon that hand,<br>    That I might touch that cheek!<br><br>  Jul. Ay me!<br><br>  Rom. She speaks.<br>    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art<br>    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,<br>    As is a winged messenger of heaven<br>    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes<br>    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br>    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds<br>    And sails upon the bosom of the air.<br><br>  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?<br>    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!<br>    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br>    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.<br><br>  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?<br><br>  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.<br>    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,<br>    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br>    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!<br>    What's in a name? That which we call a rose<br>    By any other name would smell as sweet.<br>    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,<br>    Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br>    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;<br>    And for that name, which is no part of thee,<br>    Take all myself.<br><br>  Rom. I take thee at thy word.<br>    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;<br>    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.<br><br>  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,<br>    So stumblest on my counsel?<br><br>  Rom. By a name<br>    I know not how to tell thee who I am.<br>    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br>    Because it is an enemy to thee.<br>    Had I it written, I would tear the word.<br><br>  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words<br>    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.<br>    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?<br><br>  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.<br><br>  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br>    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br>    And the place death, considering who thou art,<br>    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.<br><br>  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;<br>    For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br>    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.<br>    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.<br><br>  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.<br><br>  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br>    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,<br>    And I am proof against their enmity.<br><br>  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.<br><br>  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;<br>    And but thou love me, let them find me here.<br>    My life were better ended by their hate<br>    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.<br><br>  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?<br><br>  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.<br>    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.<br>    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far<br>    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,<br>    I would adventure for such merchandise.<br><br>  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;<br>    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br>    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.<br>    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny<br>    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!<br>    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';<br>    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,<br>    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,<br>    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.<br>    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,<br>    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,<br>    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.<br>    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br>    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;<br>    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true<br>    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br>    I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,<br>    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,<br>    And not impute this yielding to light love,<br>    Which the dark night hath so discovered.<br><br>  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,<br>    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-<br><br>  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,<br>    That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br>    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.<br><br>  Rom. What shall I swear by?<br><br>  Jul. Do not swear at all;<br>    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br>    Which is the god of my idolatry,<br>    And I'll believe thee.<br><br>  Rom. If my heart's dear love-<br><br>  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,<br>    I have no joy of this contract to-night.<br>    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;<br>    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br>    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!<br>    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,<br>    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.<br>    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest<br>    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!<br><br>  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?<br><br>  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?<br><br>  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.<br><br>  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;<br>    And yet I would it were to give again.<br><br>  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?<br><br>  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.<br>    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.<br>    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br>    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,<br>    The more I have, for both are infinite.<br>    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!<br>                                           [Nurse] calls within.<br>    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.<br>    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]<br><br>  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,<br>    Being in night, all this is but a dream,<br>    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.<br><br>                       Enter Juliet above.<br><br><br>  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.<br>    If that thy bent of love be honourable,<br>    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,<br>    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,<br>    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;<br>    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay<br>    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.<br><br>  Nurse. (within) Madam!<br><br>  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,<br>    I do beseech thee-<br><br>  Nurse. (within) Madam!<br><br>  Jul. By-and-by I come.-<br>    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.<br>    To-morrow will I send.<br><br>  Rom. So thrive my soul-<br><br>  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.<br><br>  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!<br>    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;<br>    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.<br><br>                     Enter Juliet again, [above].<br><br><br>  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice<br>    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!<br>    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;<br>    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,<br>    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine<br>    With repetition of my Romeo's name.<br>    Romeo!<br><br>  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.<br>    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,<br>    Like softest music to attending ears!<br><br>  Jul. Romeo!<br><br>  Rom. My dear?<br><br>  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow<br>    Shall I send to thee?<br><br>  Rom. By the hour of nine.<br><br>  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.<br>    I have forgot why I did call thee back.<br><br>  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.<br><br>  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,<br>    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.<br><br>  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,<br>    Forgetting any other home but this.<br><br>  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-<br>    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,<br>    That lets it hop a little from her hand,<br>    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br>    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,<br>    So loving-jealous of his liberty.<br><br>  Rom. I would I were thy bird.<br><br>  Jul. Sweet, so would I.<br>    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br>    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,<br>    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.<br>                                                         [Exit.]<br><br>  Rom.

Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.<br><br>  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,<br>    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.<br><br>  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,<br>    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.<br><br>  Mer. A challenge, on my life.<br><br>  Ben. Romeo will answer it.<br><br>  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.<br><br>  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,<br>    being dared.<br><br>  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white<br>    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the<br>    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's<br>    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?<br><br>  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?<br><br>  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the<br>    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing<br>    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his<br>    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very<br>    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman<br>    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the<br>    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.<br><br>  Ben. The what?<br><br>  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-<br>    these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very<br>    tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,<br>    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange<br>    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand<br>    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old<br>    bench?

O flesh, flesh, how<br>    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch<br>    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she<br>    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,<br>    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,<br>    but not to the purpose.

What counterfeit did I give you?<br><br>  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?<br><br>  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a<br>    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.<br><br>  Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a<br>    man to bow in the hams.<br><br>  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.<br><br>  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.<br><br>  Rom. A most courteous exposition.<br><br>  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.<br><br>  Rom. Pink for flower.<br><br>  Mer. Right.<br><br>  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.<br><br>  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out<br>    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may<br>    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.<br><br>  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!<br><br>  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.<br><br>  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.<br><br>  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for<br>    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am<br>    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?<br><br>  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not<br>    there for the goose.<br><br>  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.<br><br>  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!<br><br>  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.<br><br>  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?<br><br>  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch<br>    narrow to an ell broad!<br><br>  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to<br>    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.<br><br>  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now<br>    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by<br>    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a<br>    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in<br>    a hole.<br><br>  Ben. Stop there, stop there!<br><br>  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.<br><br>  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.<br><br>  Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I<br>    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to<br>    occupy the argument no longer.<br><br>  Rom. Here's goodly gear!<br><br>                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].<br><br><br>  Mer. A sail, a sail!<br><br>  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.<br><br>  Nurse. Peter!<br><br>  Peter. Anon.<br><br>  Nurse. My fan, Peter.<br><br>  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of<br>    the two.<br><br>  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.<br><br>  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.<br><br>  Nurse. Is it good-den?<br><br>  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is<br>    now upon the prick of noon.<br><br>  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!<br><br>  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.<br><br>  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'<br>    quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the<br>    young Romeo?<br><br>  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you<br>    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest<br>    of that name, for fault of a worse.<br><br>  Nurse. You say well.<br><br>  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,<br>    wisely.<br><br>  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.<br><br>  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.<br><br>  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!<br><br>  Rom. What hast thou found?<br><br>  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is<br>    something stale and hoar ere it be spent<br>                                     He walks by them and sings.<br><br>                   An old hare hoar,<br>                   And an old hare hoar,<br>                Is very good meat in Lent;<br>                   But a hare that is hoar<br>                   Is too much for a score<br>                When it hoars ere it be spent.<br><br>    Romeo, will you come to your father's?

I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant<br>    was this that was so full of his ropery?<br><br>  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and<br>    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.<br><br>  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an<br>'a<br>    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,<br>    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave!

I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my<br>    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as<br>    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the<br>    law on my side.<br><br>  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me<br>    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,<br>    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I<br>    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead<br>    her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of<br>    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and<br>    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were<br>    an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.<br><br>  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto<br>    thee-<br><br>  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,<br>    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.<br><br>  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.<br><br>  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I<br>    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.<br><br>  Rom. Bid her devise<br>    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;<br>    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell<br>    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.<br><br>  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.<br><br>  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.<br><br>  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.<br><br>  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.<br>    Within this hour my man shall be with thee<br>    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,<br>    Which to the high topgallant of my joy<br>    Must be my convoy in the secret night.<br>    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.<br>    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.<br><br>  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.<br><br>  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?<br><br>  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,<br>    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?<br><br>  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.<br><br>  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!<br>    when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in<br>    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,<br>    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I<br>    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;<br>    but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any<br>    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both<br>    with a letter?<br><br>  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.<br><br>  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I<br>    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest<br>    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you<br>    good to hear it.<br><br>  Rom.

Answer to that.<br>    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.<br>    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?<br><br>  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to<br>    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better<br>    than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a<br>    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet<br>    they are past compare.

Why, she is within.<br>    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!<br>    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,<br>    "Where is your mother?"'<br><br>  Nurse.

And what to?<br><br>  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,<br>    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a<br>    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.<br>    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no<br>    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.

Thy head is as full of quarrels<br>    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as<br>    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a<br>    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog<br>    that hath lain asleep in the sun.

Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.<br>    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink<br>    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal<br>    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered<br>    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-<br>    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br>    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br>    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;<br>    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br>    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br>    Cold death aside and with the other sends<br>    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity<br>    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,<br>    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,<br>    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br>    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br>    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br>    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;<br>    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,<br>    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,<br>    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I<br>    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;<br>    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<br>    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.<br><br>  Cap.

So tedious is this day<br>    As is the night before some festival<br>    To an impatient child that hath new robes<br>    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,<br><br>                Enter Nurse, with cords.<br><br>    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks<br>    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.<br>    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords<br>    That Romeo bid thee fetch?<br><br>  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.<br>                                             [Throws them down.]<br><br>  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands<br><br>  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!<br>    We are undone, lady, we are undone!<br>    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!<br><br>  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?<br><br>  Nurse. Romeo can,<br>    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!<br>    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!<br><br>  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?<br>    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.<br>    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'<br>    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more<br>    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.<br>    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';<br>    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'<br>    If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'<br>    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.<br><br>  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,<br>    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.<br>    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;<br>    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,<br>    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.<br><br>  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!<br>    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!<br>    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,<br>    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!<br><br>  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!<br>    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman<br>    That ever I should live to see thee dead!<br><br>  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?<br>    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?<br>    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?<br>    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!<br>    For who is living, if those two are gone?<br><br>  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;<br>    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.<br><br>  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?<br><br>  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!<br><br>  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!<br>    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?<br>    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!<br>    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!<br>    Despised substance of divinest show!<br>    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-<br>    A damned saint, an honourable villain!<br>    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell<br>    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend<br>    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?<br>    Was ever book containing such vile matter<br>    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell<br>    In such a gorgeous palace!<br><br>  Nurse. There's no trust,<br>    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,<br>    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.<br>    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.<br>    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.<br>    Shame come to Romeo!<br><br>  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue<br>    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.<br>    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;<br>    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd<br>    Sole monarch of the universal earth.<br>    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!<br><br>  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?<br><br>  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<br>    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name<br>    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?<br>    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<br>    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.<br>    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!<br>    Your tributary drops belong to woe,<br>    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.<br>    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;<br>    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.<br>    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?<br>    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,<br>    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;<br>    But O, it presses to my memory<br>    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!<br>    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'<br>    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'<br>    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death<br>    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;<br>    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship<br>    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,<br>    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'<br>    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,<br>    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?<br>    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,<br>    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word<br>    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br>    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-<br>    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br>    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.<br>    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?<br><br>  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.<br>    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.<br><br>  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,<br>    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.<br>    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,<br>    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.<br>    He made you for a highway to my bed;<br>    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.<br>    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;<br>    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!<br><br>  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo<br>    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.<br>    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.<br>    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.<br><br>  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight<br>    And bid him come to take his last farewell.<br>                                                         Exeunt.<br><br><br><br><br></div><div class="col"></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col"><h4 id="ACT III.

Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.<br>    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,<br>    And thou art wedded to calamity.<br><br>                         Enter Romeo.<br><br><br>  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom<br>    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand<br>    That I yet know not?<br><br>  Friar. Too familiar<br>    Is my dear son with such sour company.<br>    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.<br><br>  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?<br><br>  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-<br>    Not body's death, but body's banishment.<br><br>  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';<br>    For exile hath more terror in his look,<br>    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'<br><br>  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.<br>    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.<br><br>  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,<br>    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br>    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,<br>    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'<br>    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'<br>    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe<br>    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.<br><br>  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!<br>    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,<br>    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,<br>    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.<br>    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.<br><br>  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,<br>    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog<br>    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br>    Live here in heaven and may look on her;<br>    But Romeo may not. More validity,<br>    More honourable state, more courtship lives<br>    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize<br>    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand<br>    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br>    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,<br>    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br>    But Romeo may not- he is banished.<br>    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;<br>    They are free men, but I am banished.<br>    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?<br>    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,<br>    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,<br>    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?<br>    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;<br>    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,<br>    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br>    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,<br>    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?<br><br>  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.<br><br>  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.<br><br>  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;<br>    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,<br>    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.<br><br>  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!<br>    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<br>    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,<br>    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.<br><br>  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.<br><br>  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?<br><br>  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.<br><br>  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.<br>    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,<br>    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,<br>    Doting like me, and like me banished,<br>    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,<br>    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,<br>    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.<br>                                                 Knock [within].<br><br>  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.<br><br>  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,<br>    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.<br><br>  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;<br>    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.<br>    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,<br>    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.<br>    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will<br><br>  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.<br>    I come from Lady Juliet.<br><br>  Friar. Welcome then.<br><br>                       Enter Nurse.<br><br><br>  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar<br>    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?<br><br>  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.<br><br>  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,<br>    Just in her case!<br><br>  Friar. O woeful sympathy!<br>    Piteous predicament!<br><br>  Nurse. Even so lies she,<br>    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.<br>    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.<br>    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!<br>    Why should you fall into so deep an O?<br><br>  Rom. (rises) Nurse-<br><br>  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.<br><br>  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?<br>    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,<br>    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy<br>    With blood remov'd but little from her own?<br>    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says<br>    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?<br><br>  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;<br>    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,<br>    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,<br>    And then down falls again.<br><br>  Rom. As if that name,<br>    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<br>    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand<br>    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,<br>    In what vile part of this anatomy<br>    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack<br>    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]<br><br>  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.<br>    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;<br>    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote<br>    The unreasonable fury of a beast.<br>    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!<br>    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br>    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,<br>    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.<br>    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?<br>    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,<br>    By doing damned hate upon thyself?<br>    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?<br>    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet<br>    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.<br>    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,<br>    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,<br>    And usest none in that true use indeed<br>    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.<br>    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax<br>    Digressing from the valour of a man;<br>    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br>    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;<br>    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br>    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br>    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,<br>    is get afire by thine own ignorance,<br>    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.<br>    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,<br>    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.<br>    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,<br>    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.<br>    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend<br>    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.<br>    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;<br>    Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br>    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,<br>    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.<br>    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br>    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,<br>    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.<br>    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br>    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,<br>    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time<br>    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br>    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back<br>    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br>    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.<br>    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,<br>    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<br>    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.<br>    Romeo is coming.<br><br>  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night<br>    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!<br>    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.<br><br>  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.<br><br>  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.<br>    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.<br><br>  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!<br><br>  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:<br>    Either be gone before the watch be set,<br>    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.<br>    Sojourn in Mantua.

Why, how now, Juliet?<br><br>  Jul. Madam, I am not well.<br><br>  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?<br>    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<br>    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.<br>    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;<br>    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.<br><br>  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.<br><br>  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend<br>    Which you weep for.<br><br>  Jul. Feeling so the loss,<br>    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.<br><br>  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death<br>    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.<br><br>  Jul. What villain, madam?<br><br>  Lady. That same villain Romeo.<br><br>  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-<br>    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;<br>    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.<br><br>  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.<br><br>  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.<br>    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!<br><br>  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.<br>    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,<br>    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,<br>    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram<br>    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;<br>    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.<br><br>  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied<br>    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-<br>    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.<br>    Madam, if you could find out but a man<br>    To bear a poison, I would temper it;<br>    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,<br>    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<br>    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,<br>    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt<br>    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!<br><br>  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.<br>    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.<br><br>  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.<br>    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?<br><br>  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;<br>    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,<br>    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy<br>    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.<br><br>  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?<br><br>  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn<br>    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,<br>    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,<br>    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.<br><br>  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,<br>    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!<br>    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed<br>    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.<br>    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,<br>    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear<br>    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br>    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!<br><br>  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,<br>    And see how be will take it at your hands.<br><br>                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.<br><br><br>  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,<br>    But for the sunset of my brother's son<br>    It rains downright.<br>    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?<br>    Evermore show'ring? In one little body<br>    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:<br>    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br>    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is<br>    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,<br>    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,<br>    Without a sudden calm will overset<br>    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?<br>    Have you delivered to her our decree?<br><br>  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.<br>    I would the fool were married to her grave!<br><br>  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.<br>    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?<br>    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,<br>    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br>    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?<br><br>  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.<br>    Proud can I never be of what I hate,<br>    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.<br><br>  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?<br>    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-<br>    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,<br>    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,<br>    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next<br>    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,<br>    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br>    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!<br>    You tallow-face!<br><br>  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?<br><br>  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br>    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.<br><br>  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!<br>    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday<br>    Or never after look me in the face.<br>    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!<br>    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest<br>    That God had lent us but this only child;<br>    But now I see this one is one too much,<br>    And that we have a curse in having her.<br>    Out on her, hilding!<br><br>  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!<br>    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.<br><br>  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,<br>    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!<br><br>  Nurse. I speak no treason.<br><br>  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!<br><br>  Nurse. May not one speak?<br><br>  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!<br>    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,<br>    For here we need it not.<br><br>  Lady. You are too hot.<br><br>  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,<br>    At home, abroad, alone, in company,<br>    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been<br>    To have her match'd; and having now provided<br>    A gentleman of princely parentage,<br>    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,<br>    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,<br>    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-<br>    And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br>    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,<br>    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;<br>    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!<br>    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.<br>    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.<br>    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.<br>    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:<br>    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;<br>    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,<br>    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,<br>    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.<br>    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.<br><br>  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds<br>    That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br>    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!<br>    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;<br>    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed<br>    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.<br><br>  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.<br>    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.<br><br>  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br>    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.<br>    How shall that faith return again to earth<br>    Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br>    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.<br>    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br>    Upon so soft a subject as myself!<br>    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?<br>    Some comfort, nurse.<br><br>  Nurse. Faith, here it is.<br>    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing<br>    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;<br>    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br>    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br>    I think it best you married with the County.<br>    O, he's a lovely gentleman!<br>    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,<br>    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br>    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br>    I think you are happy in this second match,<br>    For it excels your first; or if it did not,<br>    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were<br>    As living here and you no use of him.<br><br>  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?<br><br>  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.<br><br>  Jul. Amen!<br><br>  Nurse. What?<br><br>  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<br>    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,<br>    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,<br>    To make confession and to be absolv'd.<br><br>  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.<br><br>  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!<br>    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,<br>    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br>    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare<br>    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!<br>    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br>    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.<br>    If all else fail, myself have power to die.

My father Capulet will have it so,<br>    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.<br><br>  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.<br>    Uneven is the course; I like it not.<br><br>  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,<br>    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;<br>    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.<br>    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous<br>    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,<br>    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage<br>    To stop the inundation of her tears,<br>    Which, too much minded by herself alone,<br>    May be put from her by society.<br>    Now do you know the reason of this haste.<br><br>  Friar.

Happily met, my lady and my wife!<br><br>  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.<br><br>  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.<br><br>  Jul. What must be shall be.<br><br>  Friar. That's a certain text.<br><br>  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?<br><br>  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.<br><br>  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.<br><br>  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.<br><br>  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.<br><br>  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,<br>    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.<br><br>  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.<br><br>  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,<br>    For it was bad enough before their spite.<br><br>  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.<br><br>  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;<br>    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.<br><br>  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.<br><br>  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.<br>    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,<br>    Or shall I come to you at evening mass<br><br>  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.<br>    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.<br><br>  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!<br>    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.<br>    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.<br><br>  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,<br>    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!<br><br>  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;<br>    It strains me past the compass of my wits.<br>    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br>    On Thursday next be married to this County.<br><br>  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,<br>    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.<br>    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,<br>    Do thou but call my resolution wise<br>    And with this knife I'll help it presently.<br>    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;<br>    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,<br>    Shall be the label to another deed,<br>    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br>    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.<br>    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,<br>    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,<br>    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br>    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that<br>    Which the commission of thy years and art<br>    Could to no issue of true honour bring.<br>    Be not so long to speak. I long to die<br>    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.<br><br>  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,<br>    Which craves as desperate an execution<br>    As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br>    If, rather than to marry County Paris<br>    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br>    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br>    A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br>    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;<br>    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.<br><br>  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br>    From off the battlements of yonder tower,<br>    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk<br>    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,<br>    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,<br>    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,<br>    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;<br>    Or bid me go into a new-made grave<br>    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-<br>    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-<br>    And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br>    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.<br><br>  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent<br>    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.<br>    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;<br>    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.<br>    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br>    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;<br>    When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse<br>    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;<br>    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;<br>    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br>    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall<br>    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;<br>    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,<br>    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;<br>    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death<br>    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,<br>    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br>    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br>    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.<br>    Then, as the manner of our country is,<br>    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier<br>    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br>    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br>    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,<br>    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;<br>    And hither shall he come; and he and I<br>    Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br>    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br>    And this shall free thee from this present shame,<br>    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear<br>    Abate thy valour in the acting it.<br><br>  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!<br><br>  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous<br>    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed<br>    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.<br><br>  Jul.

Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!<br>    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'<br>  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',<br><br>  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is<br>    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.<br>  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.<br><br>  Pet. You will not then?<br>  1. Mus. No.<br><br>  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.<br>  1. Mus. What will you give us?<br><br>  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek.

Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.<br>    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you<br>    note me?<br>  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.<br>  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.<br><br>  Pet. Then have at you with my wit!

O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you.

I do beseech you, sir, have patience.<br>    Your looks are pale and wild and do import<br>    Some misadventure.<br><br>  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.<br>    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.<br>    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?<br><br>  Man. No, my good lord.<br><br>  Rom. No matter.

O mischief, thou art swift<br>    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!<br>    I do remember an apothecary,<br>    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted<br>    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,<br>    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,<br>    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;<br>    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<br>    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins<br>    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves<br>    A beggarly account of empty boxes,<br>    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,<br>    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses<br>    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.<br>    Noting this penury, to myself I said,<br>    'An if a man did need a poison now<br>    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<br>    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'<br>    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,<br>    And this same needy man must sell it me.<br>    As I remember, this should be the house.<br>    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!<br><br>                        Enter Apothecary.<br><br><br>  Apoth. Who calls so loud?<br><br>  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.<br>    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have<br>    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear<br>    As will disperse itself through all the veins<br>    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,<br>    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath<br>    As violently as hasty powder fir'd<br>    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.<br><br>  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law<br>    Is death to any he that utters them.<br><br>  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness<br>    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,<br>    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,<br>    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:<br>    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;<br>    The world affords no law to make thee rich;<br>    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.<br><br>  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.<br><br>  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.<br><br>  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will<br>    And drink it off, and if you had the strength<br>    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.<br><br>  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,<br>    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,<br>    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.<br>    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.<br>    Farewell.

Shall I believe<br>    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,<br>    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br>    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>    For fear of that I still will stay with thee<br>    And never from this palace of dim night<br>    Depart again. Here, here will I remain<br>    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here<br>    Will I set up my everlasting rest<br>    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br>    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<br>    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you<br>    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br>    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!<br>    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!<br>    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br>    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!<br>    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!<br>    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.<br><br>    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.<br><br><br>  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night<br>    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?<br><br>  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.<br><br>  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,<br>    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light<br>    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,<br>    It burneth in the Capels' monument.<br><br>  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,<br>    One that you love.<br><br>  Friar. Who is it?<br><br>  Bal. Romeo.<br><br>  Friar. How long hath he been there?<br><br>  Bal. Full half an hour.<br><br>  Friar. Go with me to the vault.<br><br>  Bal. I dare not, sir.<br>    My master knows not but I am gone hence,<br>    And fearfully did menace me with death<br>    If I did stay to look on his intents.<br><br>  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.<br>    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.<br><br>  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,<br>    I dreamt my master and another fought,<br>    And that my master slew him.<br><br>  Friar. Romeo!<br>    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains<br>    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?<br>    What mean these masterless and gory swords<br>    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]<br>    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?<br>    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour<br>    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.<br>                                                   Juliet rises.<br><br>  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?<br>    I do remember well where I should be,<br>    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?<br><br>  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest<br>    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.<br>    A greater power than we can contradict<br>    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.<br>    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;<br>    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee<br>    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.<br>    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.<br>    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.<br><br>  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.<br>                                                   Exit [Friar].<br>    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?<br>    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.<br>    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop<br>    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.<br>    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them<br>    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]<br>    Thy lips are warm!<br><br>  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?<br>    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!<br>                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]<br>    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.<br>                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].<br><br>                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.<br><br><br>  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.<br><br>  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.<br>    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.<br>                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]<br>    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;<br>    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,<br>    Who here hath lain this two days buried.<br>    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;<br>    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.<br>                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]<br>    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,<br>    But the true ground of all these piteous woes<br>    We cannot without circumstance descry.<br><br>     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].<br><br>  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.<br><br>  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.<br><br>          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.<br><br>  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.<br>    We took this mattock and this spade from him<br>    As he was coming from this churchyard side.<br><br>  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.<br><br>              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].<br><br><br>  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,<br>    That calls our person from our morning rest?<br><br>            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].<br><br><br>  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?<br><br>  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'<br>    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,<br>    With open outcry, toward our monument.<br><br>  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?<br><br>  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;<br>    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,<br>    Warm and new kill'd.<br><br>  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.<br><br>  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,<br>    With instruments upon them fit to open<br>    These dead men's tombs.<br><br>  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!<br>    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house<br>    Is empty on the back of Montague,<br>    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!<br><br>  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell<br>    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.<br><br>               Enter Montague [and others].<br><br><br>  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up<br>    To see thy son and heir more early down.<br><br>  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!<br>    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.<br>    What further woe conspires against mine age?<br><br>  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.<br><br>  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,<br>    To press before thy father to a grave?<br><br>  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,<br>    Till we can clear these ambiguities<br>    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;<br>    And then will I be general of your woes<br>    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,<br>    And let mischance be slave to patience.<br>    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.<br><br>  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,<br>    Yet most suspected, as the time and place<br>    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;<br>    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge<br>    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.<br><br>  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.<br><br>  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br>    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br>    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br>    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.<br>    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day<br>    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death<br>    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;<br>    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.<br>    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br>    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce<br>    To County Paris. Then comes she to me<br>    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean<br>    To rid her from this second marriage,<br>    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)<br>    A sleeping potion; which so took effect<br>    As I intended, for it wrought on her<br>    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo<br>    That he should hither come as this dire night<br>    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,<br>    Being the time the potion's force should cease.<br>    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br>    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight<br>    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone<br>    At the prefixed hour of her waking<br>    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;<br>    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell<br>    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.<br>    But when I came, some minute ere the time<br>    Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br>    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br>    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth<br>    And bear this work of heaven with patience;<br>    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,<br>    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br>    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br>    All this I know, and to the marriage<br>    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this<br>    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br>    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,<br>    Unto the rigour of severest law.<br><br>  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.<br>    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?<br><br>  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;<br>    And then in post he came from Mantua<br>    To this same place, to this same monument.<br>    This letter he early bid me give his father,<br>    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,<br>    If I departed not and left him there.<br><br>  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.<br>    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?<br>    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?<br><br>  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;<br>    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.<br>    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;<br>    And by-and-by my master drew on him;<br>    And then I ran away to call the watch.<br><br>  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,<br>    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;<br>    And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br>    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal<br>    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<br>    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,<br>    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br>    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!<br>    And I, for winking at you, discords too,<br>    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.<br><br>  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.<br>    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more<br>    Can I demand.<br><br>  Mon. But I can give thee more;<br>    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,<br>    That whiles Verona by that name is known,<br>    There shall no figure at such rate be set<br>    As that of true and faithful Juliet.<br><br>  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-<br>    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!<br><br>  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.<br>    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br>    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;<br>    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;<br>    For never was a story of more woe<br>    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.<br>                                                   Exeunt omnes.<br><br>THE END<br></div><div class="col"></div></div></div></div></body></html>
